### SOLID Principles Implementation

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each service handles one specific domain (ForumService, RetroService, etc.)
- Components are focused on specific UI elements
- Hooks separate data fetching from presentation

#### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Template system for retrospectives allows extension without modification
- Export system supports multiple formats through a common interface
- Forum components use composition for extensibility

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Base service classes can be replaced with specialized implementations
- Component inheritance maintains expected behavior
- Error handling follows consistent patterns

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Service interfaces are client-specific
- React components accept only necessary props
- Custom hooks expose relevant functionality

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Services depend on abstractions
- Components communicate through defined interfaces
- Configuration injection for flexibility
